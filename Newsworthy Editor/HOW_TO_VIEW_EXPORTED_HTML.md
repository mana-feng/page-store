# 📺 How to View Exported HTML Files with YouTube Videos

## ✨ **NEW: Smart Video Fallback System**

Your exported HTML files now include an **intelligent video handling system**:

### 🎯 What You'll See

**Opening HTML directly (double-click):**
- ✅ Beautiful YouTube video thumbnails with play buttons
- ✅ Click any thumbnail → Opens video on YouTube.com in new tab
- ✅ Works perfectly offline, no web server needed!

**Opening via web server:**
- ✅ Click thumbnails → Videos play embedded in the page
- ✅ Full interactive experience without leaving the page

## 🐛 Why Videos Don't Auto-Play with `file://` Protocol

When you open an HTML file directly (using `file://` protocol), browsers block YouTube iframes due to **Mixed Content Security Policy**:
- Your file uses `file://` protocol
- YouTube uses `https://` protocol  
- Browsers prevent loading secure (`https://`) content from insecure (`file://`) context

**Our Solution:** We show clickable video thumbnails that link to YouTube when opened directly!

## ✅ Solutions

### **Option 1: Use a Local Web Server (Recommended)**

#### Using Python (if installed):
```bash
# Navigate to the folder containing your HTML file
cd path/to/your/folder

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000/your-file.html`

#### Using VS Code Live Server Extension:
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click your HTML file
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

#### Using Node.js http-server:
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to folder
cd path/to/your/folder

# Start server
http-server -p 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000/your-file.html`

### **Option 2: Upload to Web Hosting**

Upload your HTML file to any web hosting service:
- GitHub Pages (free)
- Netlify (free)
- Vercel (free)
- Your own web server

### **Option 3: Use the Built-in Storage Manager**

The editor has a built-in feature to save and publish to GitHub Pages:
1. Click "💾 Storage Manager" in the sidebar
2. Save your page
3. It will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
4. Share the generated URL with others

## 📝 Technical Details

The exported HTML now includes:
- ✅ `youtube-nocookie.com` domain for better privacy
- ✅ Warning banner that appears when using `file://` protocol
- ✅ Proper iframe security attributes
- ✅ Comments explaining the issue

## 🎯 Quick Test

To verify if videos work:
1. Start a local server (see Option 1 above)
2. Open the HTML file through `http://localhost`
3. Videos should play normally! 🎉
